If you are a fan of Dragon Age Inquisition, you might also be interested in some of the downloadable content (DLC) that adds more content and features to the game. There are three major DLCs that you can purchase and download: Jaws of Hakkon, The Descent, and Trespasser.
 
Jaws of Hakkon is the first DLC that was released in March 2015. It takes place in a new region called Frostback Basin, where you can explore the culture and history of the Avvar people, a group of nomadic warriors. You will also face a new enemy, the Hakkonites, who worship a powerful dragon that threatens the region. The DLC adds new quests, weapons, armor, enemies, and a dragon boss fight.
 
The Descent is the second DLC that was released in August 2015. It takes place in the Deep Roads, the underground tunnels that connect the dwarven kingdoms. You will discover the secrets of the darkspawn, the corrupted creatures that plague Thedas. You will also encounter new enemies, such as the Sha-Brytol, a mysterious faction of dwarves that worship the Titans, the ancient beings that shaped the earth. The DLC adds new quests, weapons, armor, enemies, and a huge dungeon to explore.
 
Trespasser is the third and final DLC that was released in September 2015. It takes place two years after the main game's ending, and serves as an epilogue to the story. You will reunite with your companions and allies to face a new threat: the Qunari invasion. You will also learn more about the fate of the Inquisition and your character's role in the future of Thedas. The DLC adds new quests, weapons, armor, enemies, and choices that affect the outcome of the game.
