# How to Use H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7 to Debug ARM Devices
 
H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7 is a software tool that allows you to use a parallel port (LPT) as a JTAG interface for debugging ARM devices. JTAG stands for Joint Test Action Group, and it is a standard for testing and programming integrated circuits. With H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7, you can connect your ARM device to your PC via a LPT cable and use various debugging software such as GNU GNAT, ADI ES12107, or WiRFII MA1206.

In this article, we will show you how to install and configure H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7 on your Windows 7 system, and how to use it with some common debugging software.
 
## Installation and Configuration of H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7
 
To install H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7, you need to download the latest version from [this link](https://pastebin.com/jUDrmvLZ). The file is a ZIP archive that contains the executable file and some documentation. Extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice, and run the executable file. You will see a window like this:

Click on "Install" to install the driver. You may need to restart your PC after the installation. To check if the driver is installed correctly, go to Device Manager and look for "DB-9 Parallel Port" under "Ports (COM & LPT)". If you see it, then the driver is working properly.
 
To configure H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7, you need to run the executable file again and click on "Configure". You will see a window like this:

Here you can select the LPT port number that you want to use as a JTAG interface. You can also change the speed and mode of the communication. The default settings are usually fine for most cases, but you can adjust them according to your device specifications. Click on "OK" to save the configuration.
 
## Using H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7 with Debugging Software
 
Once you have installed and configured H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7, you can use it with various debugging software that support JTAG interface. Here are some examples of how to use it with some common debugging software:
 
### GNU GNAT
 
GNU GNAT is a free software development environment for Ada programming language. It supports ARM devices via JTAG interface. To use it with H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7, you need to download and install GNU GNAT from [this link](https://www.adacore.com/download). Then, you need to create a project file that specifies the target device and the JTAG interface. For example, if you want to debug an ARM-7 device connected to LPT1 port, you can create a project file like this:

    project Default is
       for Target use "arm-eabi";
       for Runtime ("Ada") use "ravenscar-sfp";
       for Main use ("main.adb");
       package Builder is
          for Switches ("Ada") use ("-g", "-O0");
       end Builder;
       package Debugger is
          for Connection use ("jlink", "-device", "ARM-7", "-if", "lpt1");
       end Debugger;
    end Default;

Save this file as default.gpr in your project folder. Then, open GNU GNAT and load this project file. You can then compile, run, and debug your Ada program using the standard commands.
 
### ADI ES12107
 
ADI ES12107 is a 2-port serial to parallel adapter that allows you to connect serial devices such as terminal emulators or modems to a parallel port. It can also be used as a JTAG interface for debugging ARM devices. To use it with H Jtag Lpt Driver Win7, you need to download and install ADI ES
